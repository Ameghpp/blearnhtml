            <p>Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric has announced that he will leave the club this summer after 12 years of service. The Croatian international made the announcement on his social media accounts, thanking the club and its fans for their support throughout his time in Madrid.</p>
            <p>Dear Madridistas,<br>
The moment has come. The moment I never wanted to arrive, but that’s football — and in life, everything has a beginning and an end… On Saturday, I’ll play my final match at the Santiago Bernabé<br>

I arrived in 2012 with the dream of wearing the shirt of the best club in the world and the ambition to achieve great things, but I could never have imagined what was to come.

Playing for Real Madrid changed my life, both as a footballer and as a person.
